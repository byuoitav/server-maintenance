# Script - Checks to see if Wowza Streaming Engine is running
# Current Server issue occurs on Ubuntu 14.04 and Wowza Streaming Engine 4.7 
# Service reports back that WowzaStreamingEngine process is stopped when the process is running.
# ps -ef | grep WowzaStreamingEngine returns that the process is running even when
# Service report back as stopped.
#
# Script will restart Wowza if the system check over port 1935 fails to return the proper response
# Script will then report back in local logs as well as over slack to a Slack app/channel
